#2019 Executive Director Report

A. Update on Operational Activities
a) General Operations
 Asset Tagging & Disposal: Tagging of all KTC fixed assets is now complete. We now have
proper inventory of all our fixed assets including location; condition; depreciation; fair
market value. Aim is to have KTC audit ready and also to comply with major
bilateral/multilateral donor agency asset management and disposal requirements. A
disposal policy plan has also been developed in an effort to free up space at KTC by
disposing of old equipment and furniture which is taking a lot of space that centre
desperately needs.
 Uniform & Dress Policy: All contracted staff have now been issued with new KTC
branded shirts and a dress policy put in place by Operations Director, Liz Aduda.
 KTC Dashboard Updated: In partnership with Proctor and Gamble and Goodera, we
have updated a sophisticated customized dashboard that captures and analyzes every
customer transaction, forming a foundation for impact monitoring and enabling our
local team to responsively and efficiently manage service delivery.
 Individual Work plan Reviews: All Directors and Managers have now developed their
respective 8 month work plans that commenced in August 2019 and end on March 31st
2020. These individual work plans will form the basis for their performance reviews
which will be held in December 2019 and March 2020. Each director and manager has
made a signed commitment to their respective work plans and each of them now have
clarity on what needs to be achieved by March 31st 2020. This work plan exercise is as a
result of the HNP Kenya strategic planning initiative led by board member, Jocelyn Kung
in July this year. The entire HNP Kenya is grateful to Jocelyn for her guidance on this
important exercise. Please see the HNP Kenya 2019/2020 strategy deck accompanying
this report.

currently under a lot of strain given the increased usage of the toilet/shower/laundry
and restaurant services over the last 4 years.
 There have been frequent breakdowns of WWMS pumps, inconsistent water fluoride
and chlorine management and issues with the E24 hybrid energy system. These all have
increased the cost of our potable water as well as that of maintaining our waste water
management and energy infrastructure.
