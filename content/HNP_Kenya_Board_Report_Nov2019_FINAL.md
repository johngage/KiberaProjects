#Executive Director’s Board Report : November, 2019
## Update on Operational Activities
### General Operations

  - Asset Tagging & Disposal: Tagging of all KTC fixed assets is now complete. We now have
proper inventory of all our fixed assets including location; condition; depreciation; fair
market value. Aim is to have KTC audit ready and also to comply with major
bilateral/multilateral donor agency asset management and disposal requirements.
    - A
disposal policy plan has also been developed in an effort to free up space at KTC by
disposing of old equipment and furniture which is taking a lot of space that centre
desperately needs.
  - Uniform & Dress Policy: All contracted staff have now been issued with new KTC
branded shirts and a dress policy put in place by Operations Director, Liz Aduda.
  - KTC Dashboard Updated:  In partnership with Proctor and Gamble and Goodera, we
have updated a sophisticated customized dashboard that captures and analyzes every
customer transaction, forming a foundation for impact monitoring and enabling our
local team to responsively and efficiently manage service delivery.
  - Individual Work plan Reviews:  All Directors and Managers have now developed their
respective 8 month work plans that commenced in August 2019 and end on March 31st , 2020. These individual work plans will form the basis for their performance reviews
which will be held in December 2019 and March 2020. Each director and manager has
made a signed commitment to their respective work plans and each of them now have
clarity on what needs to be achieved   by March 31st 2020.
  - This work plan exercise is as a
result of the HNP Kenya strategic planning initiative led by board member, Jocelyn Kung
in July this year. The entire HNP Kenya is grateful to Jocelyn for her guidance on this
important exercise.
    - Please see the HNP Kenya 2019/2020 strategy deck accompanying
this report.
- Basic Services & Maintenance
  - The KTC infrastructure (waste water management, energy and water treatment) is
currently under a lot of strain given the increased usage of the toilet/shower/laundry
and restaurant services over the last 4 years.
There have been frequent breakdowns of WWMS pumps, inconsistent water fluoride
and chlorine management and issues with the E24 hybrid energy system. These all have
increased the cost of our potable water as well as that of maintaining our waste water
management and energy infrastructure.

  - Our new Technical Services Director, Mathew Sebbagala, has carried out an in-depth
diagnostic of the KTC water, waste management and energy infrastructure and made
 some recommendations for the US board to consider.
    - Please see the suggested
solutions and financial implications in the “Matters for Board Approval” section below.

- Eco Shop
    - The Eco Shop business unit was closed in September 2019 because of low demand for
its products and services by the residents of Kibera. This business unit has consistently
under-performed relative to other revenue generating units at the KTC forcing HNP
Kenya management to repurpose the space which is now the new home for the HNP
SACCO office.

- KTC Music Studio (Sounds of Kibera)
    - The KTC Music Studio was completed in August 2019 and is now officially open for
business. A price list with the menu of services has been approved by the Executive
Director and the senior management team after months of thorough market research.
    - A studio manager and intern audio/visual recording producer have been recruited and
are currently undergoing a 2 month intensive training program under the guidance of
professional audio production specialists – Homeboyz Entertainment Group
    - In September this year the studio produced its first hit single, “Volume Iko Sawa”
featuring Israeli celebrity artist, Gilad Millo, and a group of young Kibera artists
handpicked by KTC. The track has received national airplay from all the major Kenyan
stations (Citizen Radio, KISS FM, Capital FM and Ghetto Radio) and has received over
10,000 views on YouTube in 3 weeks alone!
      - Please click on this link to watch the video:
https://youtu.be/zSMI4_hGOfk
    - This has been a huge boost to the young artists in Kibera who are now proud to be
associated with KTC.
    - HNP Kenya is confident that the music studio will generate sales of over US$10,000 in its
first year of operations.


- Cafeteria
    - The KTC Cafeteria continues to be the top revenue earner at KTC having seen an 80%
increase in sales over the past 1 year. However, food production costs remain high thus
reducing potential profitability. Efforts are being made to improve procurement systems
as well as pricing of the various menu items on offer.
    - The food quality has also improved drastically following the recruitment of an
experienced trained chef from the Kibera community – Morgan Etete
    - The cafeteria team are currently working on obtaining the necessary health and safety
certifications in order to start its outside catering services in the first quarter of 2020.


- Laundry
    - George Orao has been confirmed as the Laundry services technician bringing some
sense of operational continuity back to this department.
    - The laundry department has also received a boost from our strategic partner, The
Busara Center for Behavioral Economics through a donation of two extra industrial
grade washing machines as well as two driers.
    - Laundry dept. is currently also working with the marketing department to create
awareness amongst the community about the availability of its services not only in
Kibera but also the untapped middle class neighbourhoods  such as Langata, Ngei,
Jamhuri and Ngummo estates.

- HNP SACCO
    - The HNP Savings & Credit Cooperative or SACCO continues to face compliancy issues as
a result of poor capacity of its board and management as well as ignorance and
misunderstanding on the part of its membership who are Kibera residents.
    - In an effort
to revive and rejuvenate the SACCO, the HNP Kenya management have taken the
following important steps:
    - AGM & Elections: The HNP SACCO had its first Annual General Meeting after a
hiatus of 2 years where new and capable board members were elected to serve over
the next 12 months.
    - Capacity Building for SACCO Board, Officers & Membership: HNP Kenya has hired a
professional cooperative development consultant to assist HNP SACCO resolve its
compliancy issues. Mr. Fred Sitati will provide the following services to  HNP SACCO
management and membership:
```
1) Review of the SACCO By-laws;
2) Work with the SACCO on compliance Issues as per the Act, Rules and By-
laws;
3) Cooperative Corporate Governance;
4) Roles, Functions and Responsibilities of the Management and Supervisory
Committee members;
5) Rights and Obligations of a member;
6) Effective Credit Management
7) Review of the HNP SACCO Loan Policy;
8) Advise on investment strategies for the SACCO;
9) Training on basic book-keeping

    - Relocation of SACCO Office: The SACCO has been moved to a larger space where
the Eco-Shop used to be located to give it more visibility and accessibility to the
Kibera residents.

### Special Projects
### Kibera Talent Search 2019
  - After three successful talent search competitions in 2015, 2016 and 2018, it is now very
clear that entertainment art is desirable among Kibera youth. In order for these young
men and women to succeed in the entertainment industry, they will need professional
skills in various disciplines, as well as promising opportunities to showcase their talents
to producers and entertainment industry players.
  - KTC has created this platform where artists can showcase, perform and enhance their
artistic skills. The concerts are designed to attract media houses and music industry
stakeholders to come and interact and create linkages with the artists.
  - The finalists usually get cash prizes, music scholarships, training and mentorship
programs as well as recording deals.
  - This year auditions started in October with the finals scheduled for the first week of
December 2019.
  - Estimated budget for the entire event about US$20,000. HNP Kenya intends to fundraise
for in kind support valued at US$5,000 from various corporates and local partners and is
requesting for the balance to met by HNP USA.

### Rockefeller Foundation Lighting Project
- The first batch of solar panels arrived in Kenya in May 2019 and are currently in safe
storage at the Match Electric Warehouse just outside Nairobi.
- The second batch containing lights, collars mounting brackets and battery packs arrived
in the country on June 2019
- Installation of the lights (civil works) has encountered some delays due to a change in
regulatory requirements by  the Nairobi County government which now demand that
the lights be tested and approved by the Kenya Bureau of Standards before an official
work permit is issued.
- Communication and facilitation by County government has been overly complicated and
slow, has perhaps delayed works by more than 4 months.
- Our consultant on the ground, Andy, is working hard to ensure we get all the necessary
approvals by mid November 2019.
- It is now estimated that civil works and testing will now be completed by
January/February 2020.
- The Executive Director is following up on this on a daily basis
and will keep the US board continuously updated.

### Water Services Expansion
  - Two new water points have been established at the Kibera Catholic Church and a local
Kibera NGO called **Project Elimu **


  - Water variances continue to be an issue but have slightly decreased from between 20% - 21% to the present 17% - 19%.
  - For every 20L jerry can of water we sell at KTC, we lose 2.3 – 3L which translates to a
15% loss mainly due to spillages at the water points as well as fraudulent practices by
some of our water point attendants
  - We have taken steps to mitigate losses through fraud by deducting the value of the
water lost from the water attendants’ monthly salaries. This has slightly improved the
situation but the spillages still continue.
  - To further reduce the variances, our Technical Services Director has recommended that
we automate the water dispensing systems at the water points.

### Water Bottling Plant Business Plan
- HNP Kenya has identified a unique opportunity to further expand its water services not
only to the residents of Kibera but also the middle class neighbourhoods surrounding
the slum by establishing a mini water bottling plant.
- Our business plan estimates that the entire cost of establishing the plant at KTC will cost
approximately US$130,000
- We, at HNP Kenya, strongly believe that the water bottling and distribution business has
both enormous profit and impact potential.
- Our proposed water bottling and distribution business in Kibera and surrounding areas
is our entrepreneurial response to local consumer demand for safe drinking water that
is potentially priced lower than traditional bottled water. This type of business does well
where municipal water supplies are non-existent, unreliable and/or potentially unsafe
to drink.
- Added to this, we have also received commitment from our partner, the Jubilee
Insurance Group, to partially fund the installation of the bottling plant at KTC to the
tune of US$50,000 and to buy *all* our 20L  bottled water for its corporate headquaters
once the bottling plant is up and running.

## Key Accomplishments

### Human Resources
- New HR Officer hired: Ms. Violet Chepchumba joined KTC in April this year after a
rigorous interview process. Viola will be responsible for recruiting, screening,
interviewing and placing workers at KTC. She will also handle employee relations,
payroll, benefits, and training. She will plan, direct and coordinate the administrative
functions of KTC and oversee interns, casuals and permanent staff in their duties;
consult with HNP directors on strategic planning initiatives, and link HNP Kenya’s
management with its employees.
- Medical Insurance: HNP Kenya has increased inpatient and outpatient medical
insurance benefits for its entire staff. This has contributed to the increased levels of
motivation currently being experienced at the center.
- Leave utilization policy: This is now complete and will help HNP Kenya better plan
continuity of its critical operations without any disruptions.

### Operations
- Completion of SOP Exercise. All key KTC departments have now completed developing
their respective SOPs. The completed SOPs still need some refinements and external
assistance will be required.
- Laundry department. 2 new washers and driers have been added to the laundry room
(courtesy of the Busara research program) bringing the total number of functioning
washers to six along with 4 driers. Market research is currently being undertaken by
the HNP Kenya marketing team to determine various strategies to increase laundry
services to sports clubs in Kibera as well as the surrounding middle class
neighbourhoods.
- Revenue increases across key departments. Significant increase in revenue has been
observed from cafeteria services followed by an increase in demand for the KTC
shower and toilet facilities. Leakages in revenue vs expenses at the Point of Sales have
been identified and are currently being resolved.

### Introduction of the HNP Kenya Internship Program Supported by the Spirit Fund 2019
- The Spirit Fund was initiated by HNP USA Board member Jocelyn Kung to assist the
young people of Kibera on their path to education, personal growth, and social
involvement through the Human Needs Project.
- The Spirit Fund will provide support to hand-picked promising educational/leadership
related projects in areas where funding is either difficult to obtain or non-existent
through the regular HNP programmatic funding pipeline.
- This Fund will be a unique and valuable instrument, both in reaching Kibera’s high
potential but disadvantaged youth directly and in catalyzing the energies of a wide
range of partners, donors and the Kibera local communities.
- The Spirit Fund *will not* be used to duplicate or overlap other HNP Kenya initiatives
but, rather, serve as a specific instrument in the arsenal of technical capacity building
and educational programs that reach out to Kibera’s youth both at the KTC and the
Kibera community at large.

### Training & Strategic Partnerships
- NITA Accreditation. KTC has now officially received accreditation from the The National
Industrial Training Authority (NITA) of Kenya thanks to the hard work and efforts of
Training & Strategic Partnerships Director, **Peter Muthaura**. What this means is that
KTC can now provide training services to various organisations who will then be
refunded by the Kenya government.
- The National Industrial Training Authority in Kenya administers a training levy on behalf
of the Kenyan industry. As an accredited trainer for NITA, companies may apply to NITA
for reimbursement of training fees for KTC courses if they have paid the training levy.
This will be a boost for HNP Kenya’s capacity building & training arm.


## Current Significant Issues & Opportunities

## Opportunities
## Strategic Partnership Development

## Davis & Shirtliff Training Program
- The Davis & Shirtliff Group is the leading supplier of water related equipment in the East
African region and specializes in the manufacture and assembly of water
pumps, boreholes, swimming Pools, water treatment, generators, solar equipment and
irrigation.
- In August this year, HNP and Davis & Shirtliff entered into an agreement to collaborate
together in the provision of technical and practical training on the handling of various
issues and equipment around clean water.
- The training program started in earnest in September this year with D&S accepting 3
KTC staff from the basic services department after a thorough interview process. The 3
will undergo an intensive 3 month training on D&S water treatment and solar
equipment. The best of the three will be absorbed by D&S into their own internal
internship program and eventually hired as permanent staff. The remaining two will
return to KTC and be responsible for maintaining all water extraction and treatment
equipment supplied by D&S.

## Nikon School, Kenya Photography Training Program
- In July this year, HNP Kenya and Image Solutions Limited (also known as the Nikon
School, Kenya) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide Nikon’s, basic
and advanced training in photography to KTC students.
- Under this agreement, the Nikon School will:

```
a. Sponsor the training of two HNP staff in advanced photography.
b. Provide 10 to 20 cameras depending on the size of class, for purposes of the
training which HNP will return on a weekly basis for purposes of cleaning and
servicing.
c. Brand the photography training room at Kibera Town Centre and equip it to the
standard of Nikon’s Training Centers worldwide.
d. Use KTC Photography graduates for suitable Nikon’s events and promotions as
the official photographers.
e. Support the Video Production class with cameras suitable for video production
classes.

```


## Jubilee Insurance Group Partnership with HNP Kenya
- The Jubilee Insurance Company of Kenya  is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jubilee
Holdings Limited, a multinational insurance holding company, which maintains its
headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya
- After discussions with Connie in San Francisco and follow-up meetings with HNP
Executive Director, Jubilee Chairman, Nizar Juma has committed to purse the following
initiatives with the Kibera Town Centre.

```
a) Support our water bottling plant initiative after perusing our compelling business
plan developed by the HNP Kenya team. Jubilee will fund the water bottling plant
at KTC up to $50,000 as a loan to be paid back through Jubilee water acquisition
from KTC over 2 years. This entails supplying Jubilee Group of Companies with
800 20L bottles per month for the company water dispensers
b) Support our new KTC outside catering business idea by commissioning KTC to
supply the Jubilee Group of Companies with daily hot lunches and snacks. This
will boost sales and revenues for the KTC restaurant business unit and
consequently allowing it to break even with the next 6-7 months of business with
Jubilee.
c) Support KTC capacity building and training efforts by providing professional
mentorship to KTC managers to further KTC professional expertise in, for
example, banking (SACCO), strategic planning, HR, finance, marketing and
distribution.
d) Jubilee will provide affordable offers for End of life Insurance, Medical insurance
and a customized hybrid package of the two to our SACCO members. This is very
important to the poor residents of Kibera because, due to lack of space in the
slums, they have to bury their departed loved ones in the rural villages which is
usually hundreds of miles from Nairobi and may cost upwards of US$500 to
transport their bodies to the villages as well as the costs of the traditional burial
rituals that need to be performed.
```

## Strathmore University – Energy Research Centre Partnership with HNP Kenya

- This centre is accredited by the National Industrial Training Authority (NITA) and the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to offer training for renewable energy professions
such as solar energy.
- SERC and HNP Kenya recently signed an agreement on September 2019 whereby:
a) Strathmore Energy Research Centre (SERC) technicians will train 3 HNP staff how
to assemble solar equipment into a T1/T2 mobile training unit prototype, so in
the future HNP staff will be able to rebuild such units on their own to conduct
T1/T2 solar training at the KTC.
b) This will happen parallel to the trainer of trainers (ToT) instruction that KTC will
receive from SERC
c) HNP will contribute US$900 as cost share from the Spirit fund for the acquisition
of a mobile solar unit. KCIC will contribute Ksh.216,000 towards T1 & T2 training
for 3 HNP staff for 3 months.
- This is the pilot phase of the partnership which, if successful, will lead to greater
collaboration as the project is scaled up to include more KTC trainees as well as develop
a trainer of trainers program so that KTC can eventually start  their own solar training
program in-house.

## Busara Center for Behavioral Economics service collaboration with HNP Kenya
- The Busara Center for Behavioral Economics is a US non-profit research organization
dedicated to furthering the understanding of human decision-making and enabling
government and organizations to apply this knowledge in practice. They support
researchers with questions in economics, psychology, public policy, and other disciplines
using surveys and experimental methods.
- Their primary office is in Nairobi, Kenya and is expanding operations in the United States
with a new center located in Trenton, NJ.
- Busara is currently collaborating with HNP Kenya on a research project called
“Alleviating Time Poverty among the Working Poor” whose primary purpose is to
document the impact of reductions of unpaid labor on well-being and perceived stress
in Kibera.
- The project will test a new model of economic aid based on reducing the time
constraints of individuals living in poverty. People living in material poverty tend to be
‘time poor,’ spending significantly more time on unpaid labor compared to those who
are wealthier.
- Under the service agreement signed by HNP Kenya Executive Director and Busara
Project Lead, KTC will:

```

a) provide laundry services to include washing and drying to all of the Busara’s
research participants each week until a mutually agreed upon termination date
as communicated by the Company.
b) charge Busara for laundry and drying services at commercial rates including all
incidental costs related to washing and drying clothes
c) install all new laundry machines purchased by Busara for the study. This
equipment will eventually be donated to the KTC after the completion of the
research study in January 2020
d) provide catering services as needed to all of the Busara’s research participants
over a period of 3 months. The meals provided by the KTC restaurant will include
starch, proteins and vegetables.
```

- HNP Kenya expects to make sales of over US$10,000 after the completion of this
research study through its provision of catering and laundry services. A major boost for
the two departments!
- Credit goes to our Finance Director, Felix Osumo and our Operations Director, Liz Aduda
for negotiating this important agreement.

## Black Rhino Partnership with HNP Kenya
- BlackRhino VR is a Kenyan company offering Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality
production services in Kenya. It is the first company to offer this technology in Kenya.
BlackRhino has a vision of democratizing and demystifying both VR and AR by enabling
Kenyan youth to train in VR/AR and to develop opportunities for work in this field.
- HNP Kenya has approached BlackRhino who have showed strong willingness to set up a
VR/AR Lab at KTC where Kibera youth can be trained in VR and AR; tell their stories;
make their productions and strategies on entering the market. We have a MoU drafted
and about to be signed. The envisaged timeline for the rollout is in January 2020.
- HNP and BlackRhino are also at advanced stages of discussions around the development
a virtual reality tour of our Kibera Town Centre and its associated infrastructure using
Oculus Go headsets. This will be a boost to the marketing and fundraising team both in
Kenya and the US as they talk about our work in Kibera. We are really excited about this
initiative and will discuss the possibility of acquiring 2 oculus headsets for HNP Kenya
from the US in the near future.

## Samasource Partnership with HNP Kenya
- The Samasource partnership with HNP Kenya came to an end due to what they termed
an “organization-wide strategic realignment”, which entailed scaling down on training to
focus on job-retention for those they have already trained.
- It has however been a very successful relationship, and also a model of future strategic
relationships.


## Homeboyz Entertainment Group
- The Homeboyz Entertainment Group’s CSR arm, the Homeboyz Foundation advances
youth empowerment through sport; entertainment; media; entrepreneurship, talent
development; skills advancement and civic engagement to young people.
- The Homeboyz Foundation is interested into entering into a partnership agreement
where they can work with KTC to train Kibera youth in sound production, artist
development, radio presenter training and experiential marketing.
- HNP Kenya is currently developing a MoU for review by Homeboyz Foundation.

## Water Services Expansion
- Demand for KTC’s water services from the surrounding community continues to steadily
grow.
- Discussions are at advanced stages to supply water services to various institutions in
Kibera i.e. Spurgeon Care School, Carolina for Kibera, Olympic Catholic Church, St.
Vincent’s Rescue Centre and the Youth Reforms organization.
- There are also ongoing discussions for KTC to provide water services to Karanja Estate.
However this will be put on hold to await the findings of the water diagnostic to be
carried out by **Water for People** and **Johns Hopkins University**.


## Matters for Approval

### HNP Kenya Board Recruitment
- The current Kenya board has outlived its usefulness and it is time to inject fresh blood in
HNP Kenya. The Executive Director has already sent letters thanking the current board for
their services over the last 4 years and is actively looking for new board members who can
contribute positively to HNP Kenya.
- The HNP Kenya Board of Directors will be the governance and leadership arm of Human
Needs Project in Kenya. All members and officers of the Kenya Board will be volunteers
and serve without remuneration. As a member of the Kenya Board of Directors, efforts will
be focused on expanding Human Needs Project’s fundraising and outreach efforts. In the
Kibera community, they will serve as advocates of Human Needs Project’s programs and
business services.
- The Executive Director requests the US Board’s permission to complete this exercise so
that we can have a Kenya board in place by January 2020.

### Overhaul of the KTC Water Treatment; Waste Water Management & Energy Infrastructure
Our Technical Services Director recommends the following measures for board approval:

- Overhaul of Plumbing Works at KTC: The current plumbing at the KTC is riddled with
leaks and some pipe work is extraneous and needlessly complicated. PPR pipes need to
be replaced with CPVC pipes. This applies to all systems including the hot water and
waste water.  By simplifying the plumbing and replacing leaking pipe-work, we will be
increasing efficiency of delivery and will allow easier troubleshooting procedures as well
as increase the lifetime of plumbing fittings and pumps associated with conveying water
around the building .Estimated Cost: **US$10,500**

- WWMS Pumps need to be checked and float switch replaced:  The pumps have been
running consistently for 6 years and are in need of an overhaul to replace parts and
make them more efficient. We believe that this will lead to increased efficiency and
reduced downtime that is being currently experienced at KTC. Estimated cost: **US$2,500**

- Septic tanks 1 and 2 need a complete evacuation: Over the years, sand and grit have
built up in the KTC septic tanks reaching upwards of 1 foot thus effectively reducing
capacity of the septic vaults. The septic vaults have seen an increase in fluid retention
time as well as initial anaerobic sedimentation thus increasing bacterial action in the
AUF's. Reduced efficiency here causes problems downstream. Estimated cost: **US$3,500**
(20 trucks will be needed for this evacuation)

- Installation of a sump pump back-up system: High failure rates of the pump due to
increased operational tempo at the KTC (restaurant, toilets and showers) have been
regularly experienced hence the need for another back-up sump pump to meet the
increased demand on the system. This will reduce turn-around time between repairs at
DNS and re-installation. Estimated cost: **US$1,000**

- Replacement of control board of the WWMS: The current components need
replacement i.e. contractors and addition of RCD'S for extra protection. By replacing the
electrical components and adding better protection devices we will significantly increase
the efficiency of delivery and allow for easier troubleshooting procedures as well as
increase the lifetime of the pumps associated with conveying water around the WWMS
system. Estimated Costs: **US$1,500**

- E24 Inverter System Repairs: One of the E24 inverters is not working and the
manufacturers have offered to get us a new one, at a cost. Getting a new inverter would
increase our solar power production hence cutting down our electrical bill which
currently stands at US$8,000 per month. There is also need to send the basic services
team to Lebanon for a refresher course. Estimated Cost: **US$ 8,000**

- Generator Repairs urgently required: The generator is meant to be a part of the hybrid
energy system but is currently not functioning. The existing Genset control panel is
damaged and requires replacement ASAP. We will require a newer version of the DSE
control panel that will allow for proper communication between the E24 energy system
so as to increase power supply delivery and allow for better control by the operators.
The Genset fuel storage tank is also damaged and not serviceable. Estimated costs: **US$5,000**



- Installation of Solenoid Valves:  The current plumbing at the KTC is manually operated.
A solenoid valve system will allow for immediate delivery at the point of need without
having to depend on operators moving from point to point opening and closing valves.
This, in turn,  will reduce the turn-around time between receiving a production request
and delivery to a point of need at all times of the day. Estimated Cost: **US$1,000**

- Water Sprinklers - for Olympic Primary Soccer Field: As it stands, KTC currently doesn’t
have a defined use for its recycled water and, as such, we dump all our treated waste
water into the open sewer system in Kibera. This is a huge waste of a potential water
resource. We recommend diverting this water to “green” the neighbouring Olympic
Primary School soccer field and hence reduce the dust that continues to reduce the
efficiency of our solar panels on the KTC roof. Estimated Cost: **US$3,000**
Thus, the total amount required for overhauling the KTC water treatment, waste water
management and energy infrastructure is approximately **US$36,000**

Sincerely,

Nzuki Waita
Executive Director, Kenya
