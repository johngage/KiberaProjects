#Defluoridation

Our usual fluoride level is between 6 mg/L and 8 mg/L.  The Kenyan standard is 4 mg/L; the WHO standard is 1.5 mg/L.

Our desired level is under 1.0 mg/L.

We achieve that by adsorbing excess fluoride in a  ?500 Liter treatment tank filled with activated alumina, provided by Davis and Shirtliff.

One tank will reduce fluoride levels below 1 mg/L for a total volume of 75,000 cubic meters of water.

Our daily flow is 80 M3; one year: 30,000 M3;
