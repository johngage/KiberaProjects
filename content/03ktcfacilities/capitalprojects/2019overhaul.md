### Overhaul of the KTC Water Treatment;

Waste Water Management & Energy Infrastructure


Our Technical Services Director recommends the following measures for board approval:

**Overhaul of Plumbing Works at KTC**:

Problem | Proposed Solution | Comments| Cost
:--- | :--- | :---| :---
 The current plumbing at the KTC is riddled with leaks and some pipe work is extraneous and needlessly complicated. | **PPR pipes need to be replaced with CPVC pipes**. |This applies to all systems including the hot water andwaste water.  By simplifying the plumbing and replacing leaking pipe-work, we will be increasing efficiency of delivery and will allow easier troubleshooting procedures as well as increase the lifetime of plumbing fittings and pumps associated with conveying wateraround the building.|Estimated Cost: **US$10,500**
|**WWMS Pumps need to be checked and float switch replaced:**  | The pumps have beenrunning _continuously_ for 6 years and are in need of an overhaul to replace parts and make them more efficient. We believe that this will lead to increased efficiency and reduced downtime that is being currently experienced at KTC.|Estimated cost: **US$2,500**
|**Septic tanks 1 and 2 need a complete evacuation:** |Over the years, sand and grit have built up in the KTC septic tanks reaching upwards of 1 foot thus effectively reducing capacity of the septic vaults. The septic vaults have seen an increase in fluid retention time as well as initial anaerobic sedimentation thus increasing (_DECREASING_) bacterial action in the AUF's. Reduced efficiency here causes problems downstream. |Estimated cost: **US$3,500**
(20 trucks will be needed for this evacuation)

- **Installation of a sump pump back-up system:**

  - High failure rates of the pump due to
increased operational tempo at the KTC (restaurant, toilets and showers) have been
regularly experienced hence the need for another back-up sump pump to meet the
increased demand on the system. This will reduce turn-around time between repairs at
DNS and re-installation.

- Estimated cost: **US$1,000**

- **Replacement of control board of the WWMS:**
  - The current components need
replacement i.e. contractors and addition of RCD'S for extra protection.
  - By replacing the
electrical components and adding better protection devices we will significantly increase
the efficiency of delivery and allow for easier troubleshooting procedures as well as
increase the lifetime of the pumps associated with conveying water around the WWMS
system.

- Estimated Costs: **US$1,500**

- **E24 Inverter System Repairs**:
  - One of the E24 inverters is not working and the
manufacturers have offered to get us a new one, at a cost.
  - Getting a new inverter would
increase our solar power production hence cutting down our **electrical bill which
currently stands at US$8,000** per month. There is also need to send the basic services
team to Lebanon for a refresher course.

- Estimated Cost: **US$ 8,000**

- **Generator Repairs urgently required**:
  - The generator is meant to be a part of the hybrid
energy system **but is currently not functioning**.
  - The existing Genset control panel is
damaged and requires replacement ASAP.
  - We will require a newer version of the DSE
control panel that will allow for proper communication between the E24 energy system
so as to increase power supply delivery and allow for better control by the operators.
  - The Genset fuel storage tank is also damaged and not serviceable.
- Estimated costs: **US$5,000**



- **Installation of Solenoid Valve**s:
  - The current plumbing at the KTC is manually operated.
  - A solenoid valve system will allow for immediate delivery at the point of need without
having to depend on operators moving from point to point opening and closing valves.
- This, in turn,  will reduce the turn-around time between receiving a production request
and delivery to a point of need at all times of the day.

- Estimated Cost: **US$1,000**

- Water Sprinklers - for Olympic Primary Soccer Field:
  - As it stands, **KTC currently doesn’t
have a defined use for its recycled water** and, as such, we dump all our treated waste
water into the open sewer system in Kibera.
  - This is a huge waste of a potential water
resource. We recommend diverting this water to “green” the neighbouring Olympic
Primary School soccer field and hence reduce the dust that continues to reduce the
efficiency of our solar panels on the KTC roof.

- Estimated Cost: **US$3,000**

- Thus, the total amount required for overhauling the KTC water treatment, waste water
management and energy infrastructure is approximately **US$36,000**
