### First Links

In 2010, the Danish-American actress, Connie Nielsen, was asked by a friend of hers, the Danish director, ...... ......., to read a script; the plot followed the true story of a Danish doctor, ....  ...., who adopted a young Kiberan boy, brought him to Copenhagen for school, and, ten years later, brought him back to Nairobi to visit. Connie funded the movie, and in 2011, spent several months building a production team.

[David Warner][David] and [Chris Sutton][chris] were the prime movers in building the KTC.  David supervised the architectural and engineering design, and Chris Sutton lived in Nairobi for two years supervising the construction.

Over 400 Kibera workers formed the construction teams.
